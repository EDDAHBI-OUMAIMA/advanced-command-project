In order to be able to control our system, we need to model it first, and to do this we have established a thermal study (for the system temperatures) and another hydraulic (flow rate and position of the valves) 
**Thermal study:**
=====
Considering variable thermal regimes gives rise to two necessities, which are complementary: the correct evaluation of thermal performance, and the prediction of output parameters. Their control determines the energy efficiency and quality of the processes (in particular through control and regulation), and also sometimes the reliability of the systems (particularly with regard to thermal constraints). Let's start by expressing the total heat balance of the heat exchanger as a function of time, for any variable regime. If we neglect the dissipation function Î¦, the local enthalpy balance is written for an isochoric fluid:![image](https://github.com/EDDAHBI-OUMAIMA/advanced-command-project/assets/147321335/1f2786c7-c431-4d59-a5f0-bc9212521b9a)
